# http-status-codes

Constants enumerating the HTTP status codes. Based on the [Java Apache HttpStatus API](http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/HttpStatus.html).

All status codes defined in RFC1945 (HTTP/1.0), RFC2616 (HTTP/1.1), RFC2518 (WebDAV), RFC6585 (Additional HTTP Status Codes), and RFC7538 (Permanent Redirect) are supported.

TypeScript or JavaScript. Completely library agnostic. No dependencies.

## Installation

```console
npm install http-status-codes --save
```

## Usage (express 4.x)

```typescript
import {
	ReasonPhrases,
	StatusCodes,
	getReasonPhrase,
	getStatusCode,
} from 'http-status-codes';

response
	.status(StatusCodes.OK)
	.send(ReasonPhrases.OK);

response
	.status(StatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
	.send({
		error: getReasonPhrase(StatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
	});

response
	.status(getStatusCode('Internal Server Error'))
	.send({
		error: 'Internal Server Error'
	});
```

## Migrating from v1.x.x

http-status-codes v2 is mostly backwards compatible with v1. There is a single breaking change and two recommended changes.

#### [Breaking Change] 'Server Error'

The reason phrase for the status code `500` has been changed from `"Server Error"` to `"Internal Server Error"`. This is the correct phrase according to RFC7231. If you are migrating from v1, and have code that relies on the result of `getStatusText(500)` or `getReasonPhrase('Server Error')`, then this could affect you.

#### [Non-breaking change] getStatusText renamed getReasonPhrase

The function `getStatusText` has been renamed to `getReasonPhrase`. The old function is still available, but may be deprecated in a future version. To fix this simply rename instances of `getStatusText()` to `getReasonPhrase()`. The function is otherwise the same as it was before.

#### [Non-breaking change] StatusCodes

In http-status-codes v1, Status Codes were exported directly from the top-level module. i.e. `HttpStatus.OK`. In v2 all Status Codes live under an object called `StatusCodes`. i.e. `HttpStatus.StatusCodes.OK`. We made this change to cater to TypeScript users who prefer a dedicated value with an enum type. The previous values are still exported, but we won't continue to update them. Please migrate if you're using the old-style imports.

## Proposing a new status code

If you'd like to propose a new status code, feel free to update "codes.json" with the necessary
information and open a pull request. There is no need to modify source code or even this README.
This is done automatically by `npm run update-codes`.

In general, we try to include only codes that have an official RFC and have been approved, however
exceptions can be made if the code is already in widespread use in the wild.

## Steps to build and publish

```shell
npm run update-codes
npm run test
npm run build
npm version [major | minor | patch]
npm run publish
```
